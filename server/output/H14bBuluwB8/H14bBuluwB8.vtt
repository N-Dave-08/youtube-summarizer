00:00.000 --> 00:18.480
When I was 27 years old, I left a very demanding job in management consulting.

00:18.480 --> 00:26.040
For a job that was even more demanding, teaching, I went to teach seventh graders math in the

00:26.040 --> 00:31.960
New York City public schools. And like any teacher I made quizzes and tests, I gave out homework

00:31.960 --> 00:40.840
assignments. When the work came back, I calculated grades. What struck me was that IQ was not the only

00:40.840 --> 00:47.880
difference between my best and my worst students. Some of my strongest performers did not have

00:47.880 --> 00:55.400
stratospheric IQ scores. Some of my smartest kids weren't doing so well. And that got me thinking.

00:56.280 --> 01:02.360
The kinds of things you need to learn in seventh grade math, sure they're hard, ratios, decimals,

01:02.360 --> 01:09.320
the area of a parallelogram. But these concepts are not impossible. And I was firmly convinced

01:09.320 --> 01:15.480
that every one of my students could learn the material if they worked hard and long enough.

01:15.800 --> 01:23.640
After several more years of teaching, I came to the conclusion that what we need in education is a much

01:23.640 --> 01:30.280
better understanding of students and learning from a motivational perspective, from a psychological

01:30.280 --> 01:39.240
perspective. In education, the one thing we know how to measure best is IQ. But what if doing

01:39.240 --> 01:47.160
well in school and in life depends on much more than your ability to learn quickly and easily.

01:48.360 --> 01:52.920
So I left the classroom and I went to graduate school to become a psychologist.

01:53.800 --> 01:59.960
I started studying kids and adults in all kinds of super challenging settings. And in every study

01:59.960 --> 02:06.760
my question was, who is successful here and why? My research team and I went to West Point

02:06.760 --> 02:12.920
Military Academy. We tried to predict which cadets would stay in military training and which would

02:12.920 --> 02:19.480
drop out. We went to the National Spelling V and tried to predict which children would advance

02:19.480 --> 02:26.760
farthest in competition. We studied rookie teachers working in really tough neighborhoods asking

02:26.760 --> 02:32.600
which teachers are still going to be here in teaching by the end of the school year. And of those

02:32.600 --> 02:36.840
who will be the most effective at improving learning outcomes for their students.

02:37.480 --> 02:42.440
We partnered with private companies asking which of these salespeople is going to keep their jobs

02:42.440 --> 02:46.440
and who's going to earn the most money. In all those very different contexts,

02:47.640 --> 02:53.880
one characteristic emerged as a significant predictor of success. And it wasn't social intelligence,

02:54.520 --> 03:00.440
it wasn't good looks, physical health, and it wasn't IQ. It was grit.

03:00.920 --> 03:10.280
Grit is passion and perseverance for very long-term goals. Grit is having stamina. Grit is sticking with

03:10.280 --> 03:17.720
your future. Day in, day out, not just for the week, not just for the month, but for years,

03:18.440 --> 03:25.400
and working really hard to make that future a reality. Grit is living life like it's a marathon,

03:25.960 --> 03:32.280
not a sprint. A few years ago, I started studying grit in the Chicago Public Schools.

03:33.080 --> 03:38.360
I asked thousands of high school juniors to take grit questionnaires and then waited around

03:38.360 --> 03:45.160
more than a year to see who would graduate. Turns out that grittier kids were significantly more

03:45.160 --> 03:50.760
likely to graduate. Even when I matched them on every characteristic I could measure,

03:50.760 --> 03:57.720
things like family income, standardized achievement test scores, even how safe kids felt when

03:57.720 --> 04:03.400
they were at school. So it's not just at West Point or the National Spelling Bee that grit matters,

04:03.400 --> 04:07.640
it's also in school, especially for kids at risk for dropping out.

04:09.080 --> 04:15.880
To me, the most shocking thing about grit is how little we know, how little science knows about

04:15.880 --> 04:22.360
building it. Every day, parents and teachers ask me, how do I build grit in kids? What do I do to

04:22.360 --> 04:29.000
teach kids a solid work ethic? How do I keep them motivated for the long run? The honest answer is,

04:29.800 --> 04:37.240
I don't know. What I do know is that talent doesn't make you gritty. Our data show very clearly

04:37.880 --> 04:43.160
that there are many talented individuals who simply do not follow through on their commitments.

04:43.800 --> 04:50.920
In fact, in our data, grit is usually unrelated or even inversely related to measures of talent.

04:52.520 --> 04:58.600
So far, the best idea I've heard about building grit in kids is something called growth mindset.

04:59.400 --> 05:04.440
This is an idea developed at Stanford University by Carol Dweck and it is the belief

05:05.320 --> 05:10.440
that the ability to learn is not fixed, that it can change with your effort.

05:11.400 --> 05:17.640
Dr. Dweck has shown that when kids read and learn about the brain and how it changes and grows

05:17.640 --> 05:25.400
in response to challenge, they're much more likely to persevere when they fail because they don't

05:25.400 --> 05:31.880
believe that failure is a permanent condition. So growth mindset is a great idea for building grit,

05:32.680 --> 05:38.120
but we need more. And that's where I'm going to end my remarks because that's where we are.

05:38.120 --> 05:44.440
That's the work that stands before us. We need to take our best ideas, our strongest intuitions,

05:44.440 --> 05:49.160
and we need to test them. We need to measure whether we've been successful

05:49.160 --> 05:55.320
and we have to be willing to fail, to be wrong, to start over again with lessons learned.

05:56.360 --> 06:02.920
In other words, we need to be gritty about getting our kids grittier. Thank you.
