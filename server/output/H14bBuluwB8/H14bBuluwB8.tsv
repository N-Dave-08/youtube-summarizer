0	18480	When I was 27 years old, I left a very demanding job in management consulting.
18480	26040	For a job that was even more demanding, teaching, I went to teach seventh graders math in the
26040	31960	New York City public schools. And like any teacher I made quizzes and tests, I gave out homework
31960	40840	assignments. When the work came back, I calculated grades. What struck me was that IQ was not the only
40840	47880	difference between my best and my worst students. Some of my strongest performers did not have
47880	55400	stratospheric IQ scores. Some of my smartest kids weren't doing so well. And that got me thinking.
56280	62360	The kinds of things you need to learn in seventh grade math, sure they're hard, ratios, decimals,
62360	69320	the area of a parallelogram. But these concepts are not impossible. And I was firmly convinced
69320	75480	that every one of my students could learn the material if they worked hard and long enough.
75800	83640	After several more years of teaching, I came to the conclusion that what we need in education is a much
83640	90280	better understanding of students and learning from a motivational perspective, from a psychological
90280	99240	perspective. In education, the one thing we know how to measure best is IQ. But what if doing
99240	107160	well in school and in life depends on much more than your ability to learn quickly and easily.
108360	112920	So I left the classroom and I went to graduate school to become a psychologist.
113800	119960	I started studying kids and adults in all kinds of super challenging settings. And in every study
119960	126760	my question was, who is successful here and why? My research team and I went to West Point
126760	132920	Military Academy. We tried to predict which cadets would stay in military training and which would
132920	139480	drop out. We went to the National Spelling V and tried to predict which children would advance
139480	146760	farthest in competition. We studied rookie teachers working in really tough neighborhoods asking
146760	152600	which teachers are still going to be here in teaching by the end of the school year. And of those
152600	156840	who will be the most effective at improving learning outcomes for their students.
157480	162440	We partnered with private companies asking which of these salespeople is going to keep their jobs
162440	166440	and who's going to earn the most money. In all those very different contexts,
167640	173880	one characteristic emerged as a significant predictor of success. And it wasn't social intelligence,
174520	180440	it wasn't good looks, physical health, and it wasn't IQ. It was grit.
180920	190280	Grit is passion and perseverance for very long-term goals. Grit is having stamina. Grit is sticking with
190280	197720	your future. Day in, day out, not just for the week, not just for the month, but for years,
198440	205400	and working really hard to make that future a reality. Grit is living life like it's a marathon,
205960	212280	not a sprint. A few years ago, I started studying grit in the Chicago Public Schools.
213080	218360	I asked thousands of high school juniors to take grit questionnaires and then waited around
218360	225160	more than a year to see who would graduate. Turns out that grittier kids were significantly more
225160	230760	likely to graduate. Even when I matched them on every characteristic I could measure,
230760	237720	things like family income, standardized achievement test scores, even how safe kids felt when
237720	243400	they were at school. So it's not just at West Point or the National Spelling Bee that grit matters,
243400	247640	it's also in school, especially for kids at risk for dropping out.
249080	255880	To me, the most shocking thing about grit is how little we know, how little science knows about
255880	262360	building it. Every day, parents and teachers ask me, how do I build grit in kids? What do I do to
262360	269000	teach kids a solid work ethic? How do I keep them motivated for the long run? The honest answer is,
269800	277240	I don't know. What I do know is that talent doesn't make you gritty. Our data show very clearly
277880	283160	that there are many talented individuals who simply do not follow through on their commitments.
283800	290920	In fact, in our data, grit is usually unrelated or even inversely related to measures of talent.
292520	298600	So far, the best idea I've heard about building grit in kids is something called growth mindset.
299400	304440	This is an idea developed at Stanford University by Carol Dweck and it is the belief
305320	310440	that the ability to learn is not fixed, that it can change with your effort.
311400	317640	Dr. Dweck has shown that when kids read and learn about the brain and how it changes and grows
317640	325400	in response to challenge, they're much more likely to persevere when they fail because they don't
325400	331880	believe that failure is a permanent condition. So growth mindset is a great idea for building grit,
332680	338120	but we need more. And that's where I'm going to end my remarks because that's where we are.
338120	344440	That's the work that stands before us. We need to take our best ideas, our strongest intuitions,
344440	349160	and we need to test them. We need to measure whether we've been successful
349160	355320	and we have to be willing to fail, to be wrong, to start over again with lessons learned.
356360	362920	In other words, we need to be gritty about getting our kids grittier. Thank you.
