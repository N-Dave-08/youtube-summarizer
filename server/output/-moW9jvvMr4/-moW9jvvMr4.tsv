0	16760	When I was first learning to meditate, the instruction was to simply pay attention to
16760	20920	my breath and with my mind wandered to bring it back.
20920	27360	Sounded simple enough, yet I'd sit on these silent retreats, sweating through t-shirts
27360	29280	in the middle of winter.
29280	32760	I take naps every chance I got because it was really hard work.
32760	35480	Actually, it was exhausting.
35480	40440	The instruction was simple enough, but I was missing something really important.
40440	43240	So why is it so hard to pay attention?
43240	47800	Well studies show that even when we're really trying to pay attention to something, like
47800	53360	maybe this talk, at some point about half of us will drift off into a daydream or have
53360	56480	this urge to check our Twitter feed.
56480	59160	So what's going on here?
59160	63360	It turns out that we're fighting one of the most evolutionarily conserved learning processes
63360	68160	currently known in science, one that's conserved back to the most basic nervous systems known
68160	69960	to man.
69960	74000	This reward-based learning process is called positive and negative reinforcement and basically
74000	76320	goes like this.
76320	80720	We see some food that looks good, our brain says, calories, survival.
80720	85480	We eat the food, we taste it, it tastes good, and especially with sugar, our bodies send
85480	91440	a signal to our brain that says, remember what you're eating and where you found it.
91440	96720	We lay down this context-dependent memory and learn to repeat the process next time.
96720	101240	See food, eat food, feel good, repeat.
101240	103840	Trigger, behavior, reward.
103840	106080	Simple right?
106080	110520	Well after a while our creative brain say, you know what, you can use this for more than
110520	116080	just remembering where food is, you know next time you feel bad, why don't you try eating
116080	119840	something good so you'll feel better?
119840	124880	We thank our brains for the great idea, try this, and quickly learn that if we eat chocolate
124880	128920	or ice cream when we're mad or sad we feel better.
128920	135000	Same process, just a different trigger, instead of this hunger signal coming from our stomach,
135000	139320	this emotional signal, feeling sad triggers others to eat.
139320	145240	Maybe in our teenage years we were a nerd at school and we see those rebel kids outside
145240	149920	smoking we think, hey I want to be cool so we start smoking.
149920	153760	The Marlboro man wasn't a dork and that was no accident.
153760	160800	See cool, smoke to be cool, feel good, repeat, trigger, behavior, reward.
160800	166040	And each time we do this we learn to repeat the process and it becomes a habit.
166040	171640	So later feeling stressed out triggers that urge to smoke a cigarette or to eat something
171640	173400	sweet.
173400	178640	Now with these same brain processes we've gone from learning to survive to literally
178640	183800	killing ourselves with these habits, obesity and smoking among the leading preventable
183800	187600	causes of morbidity and mortality in the world.
187600	193560	So back to my breath, what if instead of fighting our brains or trying to force ourselves
193560	198840	to pay attention we instead tapped into this natural reward-based learning process but
198840	200720	added a twist.
200720	204800	What if instead we just got really curious about what was happening in our momentary experience.
204800	206800	I'll give you an example.
206800	211320	In my lab we studied whether mindfulness training could help people quit smoking.
211320	215920	Now just like trying to force myself to pay attention on my breath they could try to
215920	221200	force themselves to quit smoking and the majority of them had tried this before and failed
221200	224080	on average six times.
224080	228120	Now with mindfulness training we dropped a bit about forcing and instead focused on being
228120	229120	curious.
229120	233000	In fact, we even told them to smoke.
233000	234000	What?
234000	238640	We said go ahead and smoke just be really curious about what is like when you do and what
238640	239640	did they notice.
239640	242920	Well here's an example from one of our smokers.
242920	249800	She said mindful smoking smells like stinky cheese and tastes like chemicals, yuck.
249800	255840	Now she knew cognitively that smoking was bad for her, that's why she joined our program.
255840	262040	What she discovered just by being curiously aware when she smoked was that smoking tastes
262040	266440	like shit.
266440	272480	Now she moved from knowledge to wisdom, she moved from knowing in her head that smoking
272480	278440	was bad for her to knowing it in her bones and the spell of smoking was broken.
278440	283160	She started to become disenchanted with her behavior.
283160	288800	Now the prefrontal cortex, that youngest part of our brain from an evolutionary perspective,
288800	294360	it understands on an intellectual level that we shouldn't smoke and it tries its hardest
294360	299120	to help us change our behavior, to help us stop smoking, to help us stop eating that
299120	303120	second, that third, that fourth cookie.
303120	308120	We call this cognitive control, we're using cognition to control our behavior.
308120	312080	Unfortunately this is also the first part of a brain that goes offline when we get stressed
312080	314560	out, which isn't that helpful.
314560	318800	Now we can all relate to this in our own experience, we're much more likely to do things like
318800	322840	yell at our spouser kids when we're stressed out or tired, even though we know it's not going
322840	327280	to be helpful, we just can't help ourselves.
327280	331720	Now when the prefrontal cortex goes offline, we fall back into our whole habits, which
331720	334600	is why this disenchantment is so important.
334600	338680	Seeing what we get from our habits helps us understand them in a deeper level, to know
338680	342200	it in our own bones, so we don't have to force ourselves to hold back or restrain ourselves
342200	346640	from behavior, we're just less interested in doing it in the first place.
346640	351360	And this is what mindfulness is all about, seeing really clearly what we get when we get
351360	358400	caught up in our behaviors, becoming disenchanted on a visceral level, and from this disenchanted
358400	361120	stance naturally letting go.
361120	365560	This isn't to say that, poof, magically we quit smoking, but over time, as we learn
365560	370040	to see more and more clearly the results of our actions, we let go of old habits and
370040	372240	form new ones.
372240	376640	The paradox here is that mindfulness is just about being really interested in getting
376640	382080	close and personal with what's actually happening in our bodies and minds from moment to moment.
382080	386080	This willingness to turn toward our experience rather than trying to make unpleasant cravings
386080	388960	go away as quickly as possible.
388960	394120	And this willingness to turn toward our experience is supported by curiosity, which is naturally
394120	395120	rewarding.
395120	396840	What does curiosity feel like?
396840	399160	It feels good.
399160	401480	And what happens when we get curious?
401480	404840	We start to notice that cravings are simply made up of body sensations.
404840	410120	Oh, there's tightness, there's tension, there's restlessness, and that these body sensations
410120	412040	come and go.
412040	417200	These are bite-sized pieces of experiences that we can manage for a moment to moment rather
417200	422640	than getting clobbered by this huge scary craving that we choke on.
422640	428640	In other words, when we get curious, we step out of our old fear-based reactive habit
428640	432120	patterns and we step into being.
432120	438280	We become this inner scientist where we're eagerly awaiting that next data point.
438280	444400	Now this might sound too simplistic to affect behavior, but in one study we found that mindfulness
444400	449200	training was twice as good as gold standard therapy at helping people quit smoking.
449200	451960	So it actually works.
451960	456360	And when we studied the brains of experienced meditators, we found that parts of a neural
456360	461320	network of self-referential processing called the default mode network were at play.
461320	465520	Now one current hypothesis is that a region of this network called the posterior cingulate
465520	470680	cortex is activated not necessarily by craving itself, but when we get caught up in it,
470680	473720	when we get sucked in and it takes us for a ride.
473720	478640	In contrast, when we let go, step out of the process just by being curiously aware of
478640	483480	what's happening, this same green region quiets down.
483480	490760	Now we're testing app and online-based mindfulness training programs that target these core mechanisms.
490760	496040	And ironically, use the same technology that's driving us to distraction to help us step
496040	501040	out of our unhealthy habit patterns of smoking, of stress-eating, and other addictive behaviors.
501800	504240	Now remember that bit about context-dependent memory?
504240	509600	We can deliver these tools to people's fingertips in the context that matter most.
509600	514240	So we can help them tap into their inherent capacity to be curiously aware right when
514240	518760	that urge to smoke or stress-eat or whatever arises.
518760	522720	So if you don't smoke or stress-eat, maybe the next time you feel this urge to check
522720	526680	your email when you're bored or you're trying to distract yourself from work, or maybe
526680	532160	to compulsively respond to that text message when you're driving, see if you can tap
532160	537840	into this natural capacity, just be curiously aware of what's happening in your body and
537840	539360	mind in that moment.
539360	544480	It will just be another chance to perpetuate one of our endless and exhaustive habit loops,
544480	546480	or step out of it.
546480	551160	Instead of see text message compulsively text back, feel a little bit better, notice the
551160	557680	urge, get curious, feel the joy of letting go, and repeat.
557680	558680	Thank you.
