00:00.000 --> 00:16.760
When I was first learning to meditate, the instruction was to simply pay attention to

00:16.760 --> 00:20.920
my breath and with my mind wandered to bring it back.

00:20.920 --> 00:27.360
Sounded simple enough, yet I'd sit on these silent retreats, sweating through t-shirts

00:27.360 --> 00:29.280
in the middle of winter.

00:29.280 --> 00:32.760
I take naps every chance I got because it was really hard work.

00:32.760 --> 00:35.480
Actually, it was exhausting.

00:35.480 --> 00:40.440
The instruction was simple enough, but I was missing something really important.

00:40.440 --> 00:43.240
So why is it so hard to pay attention?

00:43.240 --> 00:47.800
Well studies show that even when we're really trying to pay attention to something, like

00:47.800 --> 00:53.360
maybe this talk, at some point about half of us will drift off into a daydream or have

00:53.360 --> 00:56.480
this urge to check our Twitter feed.

00:56.480 --> 00:59.160
So what's going on here?

00:59.160 --> 01:03.360
It turns out that we're fighting one of the most evolutionarily conserved learning processes

01:03.360 --> 01:08.160
currently known in science, one that's conserved back to the most basic nervous systems known

01:08.160 --> 01:09.960
to man.

01:09.960 --> 01:14.000
This reward-based learning process is called positive and negative reinforcement and basically

01:14.000 --> 01:16.320
goes like this.

01:16.320 --> 01:20.720
We see some food that looks good, our brain says, calories, survival.

01:20.720 --> 01:25.480
We eat the food, we taste it, it tastes good, and especially with sugar, our bodies send

01:25.480 --> 01:31.440
a signal to our brain that says, remember what you're eating and where you found it.

01:31.440 --> 01:36.720
We lay down this context-dependent memory and learn to repeat the process next time.

01:36.720 --> 01:41.240
See food, eat food, feel good, repeat.

01:41.240 --> 01:43.840
Trigger, behavior, reward.

01:43.840 --> 01:46.080
Simple right?

01:46.080 --> 01:50.520
Well after a while our creative brain say, you know what, you can use this for more than

01:50.520 --> 01:56.080
just remembering where food is, you know next time you feel bad, why don't you try eating

01:56.080 --> 01:59.840
something good so you'll feel better?

01:59.840 --> 02:04.880
We thank our brains for the great idea, try this, and quickly learn that if we eat chocolate

02:04.880 --> 02:08.920
or ice cream when we're mad or sad we feel better.

02:08.920 --> 02:15.000
Same process, just a different trigger, instead of this hunger signal coming from our stomach,

02:15.000 --> 02:19.320
this emotional signal, feeling sad triggers others to eat.

02:19.320 --> 02:25.240
Maybe in our teenage years we were a nerd at school and we see those rebel kids outside

02:25.240 --> 02:29.920
smoking we think, hey I want to be cool so we start smoking.

02:29.920 --> 02:33.760
The Marlboro man wasn't a dork and that was no accident.

02:33.760 --> 02:40.800
See cool, smoke to be cool, feel good, repeat, trigger, behavior, reward.

02:40.800 --> 02:46.040
And each time we do this we learn to repeat the process and it becomes a habit.

02:46.040 --> 02:51.640
So later feeling stressed out triggers that urge to smoke a cigarette or to eat something

02:51.640 --> 02:53.400
sweet.

02:53.400 --> 02:58.640
Now with these same brain processes we've gone from learning to survive to literally

02:58.640 --> 03:03.800
killing ourselves with these habits, obesity and smoking among the leading preventable

03:03.800 --> 03:07.600
causes of morbidity and mortality in the world.

03:07.600 --> 03:13.560
So back to my breath, what if instead of fighting our brains or trying to force ourselves

03:13.560 --> 03:18.840
to pay attention we instead tapped into this natural reward-based learning process but

03:18.840 --> 03:20.720
added a twist.

03:20.720 --> 03:24.800
What if instead we just got really curious about what was happening in our momentary experience.

03:24.800 --> 03:26.800
I'll give you an example.

03:26.800 --> 03:31.320
In my lab we studied whether mindfulness training could help people quit smoking.

03:31.320 --> 03:35.920
Now just like trying to force myself to pay attention on my breath they could try to

03:35.920 --> 03:41.200
force themselves to quit smoking and the majority of them had tried this before and failed

03:41.200 --> 03:44.080
on average six times.

03:44.080 --> 03:48.120
Now with mindfulness training we dropped a bit about forcing and instead focused on being

03:48.120 --> 03:49.120
curious.

03:49.120 --> 03:53.000
In fact, we even told them to smoke.

03:53.000 --> 03:54.000
What?

03:54.000 --> 03:58.640
We said go ahead and smoke just be really curious about what is like when you do and what

03:58.640 --> 03:59.640
did they notice.

03:59.640 --> 04:02.920
Well here's an example from one of our smokers.

04:02.920 --> 04:09.800
She said mindful smoking smells like stinky cheese and tastes like chemicals, yuck.

04:09.800 --> 04:15.840
Now she knew cognitively that smoking was bad for her, that's why she joined our program.

04:15.840 --> 04:22.040
What she discovered just by being curiously aware when she smoked was that smoking tastes

04:22.040 --> 04:26.440
like shit.

04:26.440 --> 04:32.480
Now she moved from knowledge to wisdom, she moved from knowing in her head that smoking

04:32.480 --> 04:38.440
was bad for her to knowing it in her bones and the spell of smoking was broken.

04:38.440 --> 04:43.160
She started to become disenchanted with her behavior.

04:43.160 --> 04:48.800
Now the prefrontal cortex, that youngest part of our brain from an evolutionary perspective,

04:48.800 --> 04:54.360
it understands on an intellectual level that we shouldn't smoke and it tries its hardest

04:54.360 --> 04:59.120
to help us change our behavior, to help us stop smoking, to help us stop eating that

04:59.120 --> 05:03.120
second, that third, that fourth cookie.

05:03.120 --> 05:08.120
We call this cognitive control, we're using cognition to control our behavior.

05:08.120 --> 05:12.080
Unfortunately this is also the first part of a brain that goes offline when we get stressed

05:12.080 --> 05:14.560
out, which isn't that helpful.

05:14.560 --> 05:18.800
Now we can all relate to this in our own experience, we're much more likely to do things like

05:18.800 --> 05:22.840
yell at our spouser kids when we're stressed out or tired, even though we know it's not going

05:22.840 --> 05:27.280
to be helpful, we just can't help ourselves.

05:27.280 --> 05:31.720
Now when the prefrontal cortex goes offline, we fall back into our whole habits, which

05:31.720 --> 05:34.600
is why this disenchantment is so important.

05:34.600 --> 05:38.680
Seeing what we get from our habits helps us understand them in a deeper level, to know

05:38.680 --> 05:42.200
it in our own bones, so we don't have to force ourselves to hold back or restrain ourselves

05:42.200 --> 05:46.640
from behavior, we're just less interested in doing it in the first place.

05:46.640 --> 05:51.360
And this is what mindfulness is all about, seeing really clearly what we get when we get

05:51.360 --> 05:58.400
caught up in our behaviors, becoming disenchanted on a visceral level, and from this disenchanted

05:58.400 --> 06:01.120
stance naturally letting go.

06:01.120 --> 06:05.560
This isn't to say that, poof, magically we quit smoking, but over time, as we learn

06:05.560 --> 06:10.040
to see more and more clearly the results of our actions, we let go of old habits and

06:10.040 --> 06:12.240
form new ones.

06:12.240 --> 06:16.640
The paradox here is that mindfulness is just about being really interested in getting

06:16.640 --> 06:22.080
close and personal with what's actually happening in our bodies and minds from moment to moment.

06:22.080 --> 06:26.080
This willingness to turn toward our experience rather than trying to make unpleasant cravings

06:26.080 --> 06:28.960
go away as quickly as possible.

06:28.960 --> 06:34.120
And this willingness to turn toward our experience is supported by curiosity, which is naturally

06:34.120 --> 06:35.120
rewarding.

06:35.120 --> 06:36.840
What does curiosity feel like?

06:36.840 --> 06:39.160
It feels good.

06:39.160 --> 06:41.480
And what happens when we get curious?

06:41.480 --> 06:44.840
We start to notice that cravings are simply made up of body sensations.

06:44.840 --> 06:50.120
Oh, there's tightness, there's tension, there's restlessness, and that these body sensations

06:50.120 --> 06:52.040
come and go.

06:52.040 --> 06:57.200
These are bite-sized pieces of experiences that we can manage for a moment to moment rather

06:57.200 --> 07:02.640
than getting clobbered by this huge scary craving that we choke on.

07:02.640 --> 07:08.640
In other words, when we get curious, we step out of our old fear-based reactive habit

07:08.640 --> 07:12.120
patterns and we step into being.

07:12.120 --> 07:18.280
We become this inner scientist where we're eagerly awaiting that next data point.

07:18.280 --> 07:24.400
Now this might sound too simplistic to affect behavior, but in one study we found that mindfulness

07:24.400 --> 07:29.200
training was twice as good as gold standard therapy at helping people quit smoking.

07:29.200 --> 07:31.960
So it actually works.

07:31.960 --> 07:36.360
And when we studied the brains of experienced meditators, we found that parts of a neural

07:36.360 --> 07:41.320
network of self-referential processing called the default mode network were at play.

07:41.320 --> 07:45.520
Now one current hypothesis is that a region of this network called the posterior cingulate

07:45.520 --> 07:50.680
cortex is activated not necessarily by craving itself, but when we get caught up in it,

07:50.680 --> 07:53.720
when we get sucked in and it takes us for a ride.

07:53.720 --> 07:58.640
In contrast, when we let go, step out of the process just by being curiously aware of

07:58.640 --> 08:03.480
what's happening, this same green region quiets down.

08:03.480 --> 08:10.760
Now we're testing app and online-based mindfulness training programs that target these core mechanisms.

08:10.760 --> 08:16.040
And ironically, use the same technology that's driving us to distraction to help us step

08:16.040 --> 08:21.040
out of our unhealthy habit patterns of smoking, of stress-eating, and other addictive behaviors.

08:21.800 --> 08:24.240
Now remember that bit about context-dependent memory?

08:24.240 --> 08:29.600
We can deliver these tools to people's fingertips in the context that matter most.

08:29.600 --> 08:34.240
So we can help them tap into their inherent capacity to be curiously aware right when

08:34.240 --> 08:38.760
that urge to smoke or stress-eat or whatever arises.

08:38.760 --> 08:42.720
So if you don't smoke or stress-eat, maybe the next time you feel this urge to check

08:42.720 --> 08:46.680
your email when you're bored or you're trying to distract yourself from work, or maybe

08:46.680 --> 08:52.160
to compulsively respond to that text message when you're driving, see if you can tap

08:52.160 --> 08:57.840
into this natural capacity, just be curiously aware of what's happening in your body and

08:57.840 --> 08:59.360
mind in that moment.

08:59.360 --> 09:04.480
It will just be another chance to perpetuate one of our endless and exhaustive habit loops,

09:04.480 --> 09:06.480
or step out of it.

09:06.480 --> 09:11.160
Instead of see text message compulsively text back, feel a little bit better, notice the

09:11.160 --> 09:17.680
urge, get curious, feel the joy of letting go, and repeat.

09:17.680 --> 09:18.680
Thank you.
