1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,760
When I was first learning to meditate, the instruction was to simply pay attention to

2
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:20,920
my breath and with my mind wandered to bring it back.

3
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:27,360
Sounded simple enough, yet I'd sit on these silent retreats, sweating through t-shirts

4
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:29,280
in the middle of winter.

5
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:32,760
I take naps every chance I got because it was really hard work.

6
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:35,480
Actually, it was exhausting.

7
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:40,440
The instruction was simple enough, but I was missing something really important.

8
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:43,240
So why is it so hard to pay attention?

9
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:47,800
Well studies show that even when we're really trying to pay attention to something, like

10
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:53,360
maybe this talk, at some point about half of us will drift off into a daydream or have

11
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:56,480
this urge to check our Twitter feed.

12
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:59,160
So what's going on here?

13
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:03,360
It turns out that we're fighting one of the most evolutionarily conserved learning processes

14
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:08,160
currently known in science, one that's conserved back to the most basic nervous systems known

15
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:09,960
to man.

16
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:14,000
This reward-based learning process is called positive and negative reinforcement and basically

17
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,320
goes like this.

18
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:20,720
We see some food that looks good, our brain says, calories, survival.

19
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:25,480
We eat the food, we taste it, it tastes good, and especially with sugar, our bodies send

20
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:31,440
a signal to our brain that says, remember what you're eating and where you found it.

21
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:36,720
We lay down this context-dependent memory and learn to repeat the process next time.

22
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:41,240
See food, eat food, feel good, repeat.

23
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:43,840
Trigger, behavior, reward.

24
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:46,080
Simple right?

25
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:50,520
Well after a while our creative brain say, you know what, you can use this for more than

26
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:56,080
just remembering where food is, you know next time you feel bad, why don't you try eating

27
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:59,840
something good so you'll feel better?

28
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:04,880
We thank our brains for the great idea, try this, and quickly learn that if we eat chocolate

29
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:08,920
or ice cream when we're mad or sad we feel better.

30
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:15,000
Same process, just a different trigger, instead of this hunger signal coming from our stomach,

31
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,320
this emotional signal, feeling sad triggers others to eat.

32
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:25,240
Maybe in our teenage years we were a nerd at school and we see those rebel kids outside

33
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:29,920
smoking we think, hey I want to be cool so we start smoking.

34
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:33,760
The Marlboro man wasn't a dork and that was no accident.

35
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:40,800
See cool, smoke to be cool, feel good, repeat, trigger, behavior, reward.

36
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:46,040
And each time we do this we learn to repeat the process and it becomes a habit.

37
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:51,640
So later feeling stressed out triggers that urge to smoke a cigarette or to eat something

38
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:53,400
sweet.

39
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:58,640
Now with these same brain processes we've gone from learning to survive to literally

40
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:03,800
killing ourselves with these habits, obesity and smoking among the leading preventable

41
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:07,600
causes of morbidity and mortality in the world.

42
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:13,560
So back to my breath, what if instead of fighting our brains or trying to force ourselves

43
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:18,840
to pay attention we instead tapped into this natural reward-based learning process but

44
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,720
added a twist.

45
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:24,800
What if instead we just got really curious about what was happening in our momentary experience.

46
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,800
I'll give you an example.

47
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:31,320
In my lab we studied whether mindfulness training could help people quit smoking.

48
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:35,920
Now just like trying to force myself to pay attention on my breath they could try to

49
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:41,200
force themselves to quit smoking and the majority of them had tried this before and failed

50
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:44,080
on average six times.

51
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:48,120
Now with mindfulness training we dropped a bit about forcing and instead focused on being

52
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,120
curious.

53
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:53,000
In fact, we even told them to smoke.

54
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
What?

55
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,640
We said go ahead and smoke just be really curious about what is like when you do and what

56
00:03:58,640 --> 00:03:59,640
did they notice.

57
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:02,920
Well here's an example from one of our smokers.

58
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:09,800
She said mindful smoking smells like stinky cheese and tastes like chemicals, yuck.

59
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:15,840
Now she knew cognitively that smoking was bad for her, that's why she joined our program.

60
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:22,040
What she discovered just by being curiously aware when she smoked was that smoking tastes

61
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:26,440
like shit.

62
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:32,480
Now she moved from knowledge to wisdom, she moved from knowing in her head that smoking

63
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:38,440
was bad for her to knowing it in her bones and the spell of smoking was broken.

64
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:43,160
She started to become disenchanted with her behavior.

65
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:48,800
Now the prefrontal cortex, that youngest part of our brain from an evolutionary perspective,

66
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:54,360
it understands on an intellectual level that we shouldn't smoke and it tries its hardest

67
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:59,120
to help us change our behavior, to help us stop smoking, to help us stop eating that

68
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:03,120
second, that third, that fourth cookie.

69
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:08,120
We call this cognitive control, we're using cognition to control our behavior.

70
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:12,080
Unfortunately this is also the first part of a brain that goes offline when we get stressed

71
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:14,560
out, which isn't that helpful.

72
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:18,800
Now we can all relate to this in our own experience, we're much more likely to do things like

73
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:22,840
yell at our spouser kids when we're stressed out or tired, even though we know it's not going

74
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:27,280
to be helpful, we just can't help ourselves.

75
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:31,720
Now when the prefrontal cortex goes offline, we fall back into our whole habits, which

76
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:34,600
is why this disenchantment is so important.

77
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:38,680
Seeing what we get from our habits helps us understand them in a deeper level, to know

78
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:42,200
it in our own bones, so we don't have to force ourselves to hold back or restrain ourselves

79
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:46,640
from behavior, we're just less interested in doing it in the first place.

80
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:51,360
And this is what mindfulness is all about, seeing really clearly what we get when we get

81
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:58,400
caught up in our behaviors, becoming disenchanted on a visceral level, and from this disenchanted

82
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:01,120
stance naturally letting go.

83
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:05,560
This isn't to say that, poof, magically we quit smoking, but over time, as we learn

84
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:10,040
to see more and more clearly the results of our actions, we let go of old habits and

85
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:12,240
form new ones.

86
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:16,640
The paradox here is that mindfulness is just about being really interested in getting

87
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:22,080
close and personal with what's actually happening in our bodies and minds from moment to moment.

88
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:26,080
This willingness to turn toward our experience rather than trying to make unpleasant cravings

89
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:28,960
go away as quickly as possible.

90
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:34,120
And this willingness to turn toward our experience is supported by curiosity, which is naturally

91
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,120
rewarding.

92
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,840
What does curiosity feel like?

93
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:39,160
It feels good.

94
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:41,480
And what happens when we get curious?

95
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:44,840
We start to notice that cravings are simply made up of body sensations.

96
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:50,120
Oh, there's tightness, there's tension, there's restlessness, and that these body sensations

97
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:52,040
come and go.

98
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:57,200
These are bite-sized pieces of experiences that we can manage for a moment to moment rather

99
00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:02,640
than getting clobbered by this huge scary craving that we choke on.

100
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:08,640
In other words, when we get curious, we step out of our old fear-based reactive habit

101
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:12,120
patterns and we step into being.

102
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:18,280
We become this inner scientist where we're eagerly awaiting that next data point.

103
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:24,400
Now this might sound too simplistic to affect behavior, but in one study we found that mindfulness

104
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:29,200
training was twice as good as gold standard therapy at helping people quit smoking.

105
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:31,960
So it actually works.

106
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:36,360
And when we studied the brains of experienced meditators, we found that parts of a neural

107
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:41,320
network of self-referential processing called the default mode network were at play.

108
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:45,520
Now one current hypothesis is that a region of this network called the posterior cingulate

109
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:50,680
cortex is activated not necessarily by craving itself, but when we get caught up in it,

110
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:53,720
when we get sucked in and it takes us for a ride.

111
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:58,640
In contrast, when we let go, step out of the process just by being curiously aware of

112
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:03,480
what's happening, this same green region quiets down.

113
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:10,760
Now we're testing app and online-based mindfulness training programs that target these core mechanisms.

114
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:16,040
And ironically, use the same technology that's driving us to distraction to help us step

115
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:21,040
out of our unhealthy habit patterns of smoking, of stress-eating, and other addictive behaviors.

116
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:24,240
Now remember that bit about context-dependent memory?

117
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:29,600
We can deliver these tools to people's fingertips in the context that matter most.

118
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:34,240
So we can help them tap into their inherent capacity to be curiously aware right when

119
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:38,760
that urge to smoke or stress-eat or whatever arises.

120
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:42,720
So if you don't smoke or stress-eat, maybe the next time you feel this urge to check

121
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:46,680
your email when you're bored or you're trying to distract yourself from work, or maybe

122
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:52,160
to compulsively respond to that text message when you're driving, see if you can tap

123
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:57,840
into this natural capacity, just be curiously aware of what's happening in your body and

124
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,360
mind in that moment.

125
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:04,480
It will just be another chance to perpetuate one of our endless and exhaustive habit loops,

126
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,480
or step out of it.

127
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:11,160
Instead of see text message compulsively text back, feel a little bit better, notice the

128
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:17,680
urge, get curious, feel the joy of letting go, and repeat.

129
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:18,680
Thank you.
